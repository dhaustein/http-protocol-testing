# Test strategy

## Example test scenarios

Basic GET request verification - checks status code and content type
POST request with payload - verifies request body handling and response
Custom headers testing - ensures proper header transmission
Error handling (4xx, 5xx responses)
Authentication methods (Basic, Bearer token)
Request timeouts
Redirects handling
Content encoding (gzip, deflate)
File uploads
Cookie handling
Rate limiting*
Connection pooling*
SSL/TLS verification*
Session management
Content negotiation
Caching mechanisms

## Test Categories

Functional testing: correct behavior for valid inputs
Negative testing: handling of invalid inputs
Performance testing: response times, concurrent connections
Security testing: authentication, TLS

## Test Strategies

Mocking external services
Stubbing requests, responses
Creating controlled test environments

## Edge Cases
Network conditions (latency, packet loss)
Requests routed through additional proxies
Malformed requests/responses
Boundary conditions
Character encoding issues
Large payloads

## Example Test Cases
```python
def test_http_version_compliance():
    """
    Verify server handles HTTP version correctly
    - Must support HTTP/1.1
    - Should handle HTTP/2 upgrade
    - Must reject invalid versions
    """
    pass

def test_mandatory_headers():
    """
    Verify mandatory headers presence and format
    - Host header in HTTP/1.1
    - Content-Length or Transfer-Encoding
    - Date format
    """
    pass

def test_method_semantics():
    """
    Verify HTTP method implementations
    - GET must be safe and idempotent
    - HEAD must return same headers as GET
    - POST should not be cached by default
    """
    pass

def test_server_handles_concurrent_requests():
    """Test server can handle multiple simultaneous connections"""
    server = HTTPServer(('localhost', 8000), BaseHTTPRequestHandler)
    # Start server in separate thread
    server_thread = threading.Thread(target=server.serve_forever)
    server_thread.start()

    # Test concurrent connections
    # Cleanup
    server.shutdown()
    server_thread.join()
```
